# About this module

This is a tool module for code preprocessing that helps developers complete source code preprocessing tasks more easily. This module implements two syntax parsing engines: `Macro Definition Parsing Engine` and `PHP-Styled Template Parsing Engine`.

Based on the two engines, it exports three function components: `webpack-template-loader.js` is for webpack-loader scenarios, `simple-template-server.js` is for server scenarios, and `macro-define-processor.js` is for local file preprocessing scenarios.

This module must work with the Node.js Engine version **not lower than 12**. Some potential security problems were solved in this version.

I am still continuously writing the documentations night and day, it is really a huge and hard work. If you really want to find more details right now, please read the source code yourself.


# Install

```
npm i cwg-pretreat-js -g

After installing the module globally, you will get a command line named `cjs`. Run `cjs` in the terminal to see more help.
