# About this module

This is a tool module for code preprocessing that helps developers complete source code preprocessing tasks more easily. This module implements two syntax parsing engines: `Macro Definition Parsing Engine` and `PHP-Styled Template Parsing Engine`. Based on this, it exports three function components: `webpack-template-loader.js` is for webpack-loader scenarios, `simple-template-server.js` is for server scenarios, and `macro-define-processor.js` is for local file preprocessing scenarios.

# Install

```
npm i cwg-pretreat-js -g
```

After installing the module globally, you will get a command line named `cjs`. Run `cjs` in the terminal to see more help.
